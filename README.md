# Useful Scripts Collection

This repository contains a collection of small, useful scripts written in **Python** and **Bash**. These scripts are designed to solve simple, repetitive tasks or automate common operations. 

Each script is organized in its own folder and comes with a dedicated `README.md` file explaining how to use it.

## Purpose

- Share helpful utilities with the open-source community
- Organize frequently used scripts in a single place
- Automate daily or repetitive development/administration tasks
- Encourage collaboration and contributions

## Directory Structure

```
easy-scripts/
├── <script-name>/
│   ├── script.py / script.sh
│   ├── README.md
│   └── (optional) sample data / output / config
```

### Example:

```
easy-scripts/
└── disk-usage-check/
    ├── check_disk.sh
